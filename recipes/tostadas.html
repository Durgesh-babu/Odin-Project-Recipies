        The name usually refers to a flat or bowl-shaped tortilla that is deep-fried or toasted, but may also refer to any dish using a tostada as a base. <br> 
        It can be consumed alone, or used as a base for other foods. <br> 
        Corn tortillas are usually used for tostadas, although tostadas made of wheat or other ingredients can also be found.
